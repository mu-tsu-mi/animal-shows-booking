# Animal Shows Booking
A booking app for animal shows. 
As a user, I want to see a list of zoo zones, those of which have a list of animals. When I go to an individual animal show page, I want to create a booking for an animal show by selecting a date and # of visitors (adults and children). I also want to edit/update my booking and cancel/delete. My bookings should be in ascending order so that I can see the latest date at the top.
