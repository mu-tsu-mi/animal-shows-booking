# Animal Shows Booking
A booking app for animal shows. 
As a user, I want to see a list of zoo zones, those of which have a list of animals and a list of animal. When I go to an individual animal's page, I want to create a booking for an animal show by selecting a date and # of visitors (adults and children). I also want to edit/update my booking and cancel. My bookings should be in decending order so that I can see the latest date at the top. On each animal's page, I want to see information about the animal(API).
